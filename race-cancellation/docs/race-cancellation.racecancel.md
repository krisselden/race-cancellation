## RaceCancel type

A function that builds a race against a cancel rejection.

If the task is a function, the expectation is it will not be called if already in a cancelled state. Thus it should not close over any floating promises, in general it should just create a new promise, if it uses a cached promise it should have been already chained to something that handles its rejection.

This method can also take a promise and it will always race it even if already in a cancelled state so if the promise fails it will not cause an unhandled rejection.

Calling this function is infallible (it wont fail to return a Promise to be awaited).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type RaceCancel = <TResult>(taskOrPromise: Task<TResult> | PromiseLike<TResult>) => Promise<TResult>;
```
