## composeRaceCancel() function

Returns a [RaceCancelFn](./race-cancellation.racecancelfn.md) function that is the composition of the two RaceCancel functions.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export default function composeRaceCancel(inner?: RaceCancelFn, outer?: RaceCancelFn): RaceCancelFn;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  inner | [RaceCancelFn](./race-cancellation.racecancelfn.md) | a [RaceCancelFn](./race-cancellation.racecancelfn.md) function that is the inner function of the composition, in general its cancellation scope should be narrower than the outer scope. |
|  outer | [RaceCancelFn](./race-cancellation.racecancelfn.md) | a [RaceCancelFn](./race-cancellation.racecancelfn.md) function that is the outer function, its scope should be wider or equal to the inner scope. |

<b>Returns:</b>

[RaceCancelFn](./race-cancellation.racecancelfn.md)

## Remarks

For convenience of writing methods that take cancellations, the params are optional. If a is undefined, then b is retuned, if b is undefined then a is returned, and if they both are undefined a noop race that just invokes the task is returned.

The outer scope function is expected to be a wider concern like ctrl-C and the inner a narrower concern like timeout. This way if you catch a error then try to say sleep before a retrying the narrower concern the outer will bail out without even starting the timeout because it is already cancelled.

This isn't a hard requirement just things are optimized with that assunmption.
